      <div class="card-body"> Why Family Therapy!<br>
        We view as the back bone of the society because where would children come from if not for family?
        Maintaining a family is not easy. Family is a group of people biologically related by blood and destined to be with
        each other till death. One would say that "I did not ask for this? But do you want to be on your own? ". Family should 
        not be a burden but sometimes things take a turn. When it gets to you feeling like your family is always on you know 
        nerves. Look for a common ground that you all can relate with. I know some of you would say 'Easier said than done', well
        we offer family therapy, so if you need help, feel free to contact us.

        <div class="card-body"> People experience different things at some point in life. Don't take the wrong way but I believe 
            we have faced depression at some point in our lives which was obviously brought about by some situation.Frequently, these 
            situations may be unemployment, relationship issues, self denial, hopelessness and many other that we may know of. It's 
            human to feel all this, but it's dangerous to burden oneself with those situations. As we all know suicidial thoughts
            emerge as the last resort when these situations hit their full blown stages. We would like to prevent this by offering our
            personal therapy services. Seeking for help is not easy for some of us but we would like to encourage you to take the step
            of accepting things as they are and sort for aid when necessary.
