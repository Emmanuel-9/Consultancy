      stone. Therapy is the same be it to family, individuals and corporates as well. It is a matter of finding a common ground. 
      Individual therapy is finding your own ground, what keeps you going, what motivates, the things you want do on this earth 
      whereas for both family and corporate therapy, it's is finding a comon ground for others to relate with, though it may be in 
      times of the environment but our point is the common ground search. With this, work has being made easier. Therapy search
